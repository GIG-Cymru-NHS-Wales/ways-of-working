DRAFT + WORK IN PROGRESS + REQUEST FOR COMMENTS

Ways of Working (WoW) is a phrase that describes how people collaborate. Also known as working agreements, principles, values, tenets, norms, ground rules, group expectations, team aspirations, group understandings, company culture, and more.

You and your teammates can use this document to help with Ways of Working. This document provides an introduction then many examples of Ways of Working created by many teams.

## What are Ways of Working?

Ways of Working describes a team's set of expectations for participating, collaborating, and interrelating.

* **Principles** are fundamental truths that are the foundation for beliefs, behaviors, and reasoning. Principles are intended to be universal and permanent. Examples: "be kind", "bias for action", "encourage participation", "seek improvement", "train as a team", "think big", and "tell the truth".

* **Values** are virtues that you want such as: kindness, innovation, community, learning, teamwork, honesty. Values can be subjective and impermanent, such as "happy customers this year, large profits next year". Values can be comparative, such as "responding to change over following a plan".

* **Whys** are explanations of why something matters. Whys help people understand context. Examples: "Why is our principle X?", "Why do we value X?", "Why do we do X?", "Why are we working on this together?".

* **Tenets** are desirable attributes that should be built into all plans, directly related to the operational concept. Tenets should provide planners with criteria to evaluate whether their plans are likely to succeed. Examples: "Involve users early and often", "Leverage domain-driven design", "Drive decisions via metrics".

* **Ground rules** are guidelines of how people need to behave, for specific situations such as meetings, or activities, or tasks. Examples: "At our meetings everyone gets the opportunity to speak", "Proofread your work", "Communicate directly irrespective of hierarchy", "Use safety gear here".

* **Aspirations** are statements intended to guide interactions and decision making within the group, and also across other groups within the organization. Example: "Every challenge is an opportunity to learn".

* **Norms** are informal implicit standards of behavior that emerge over time from the interactions of the group. Example: "By observing the team, we see that teammates are punctual".

* **Working agreements** are protocols that the group develops together, commits to follow together, and agreed to uphold together. Example: "Code is complete when all tests pass".

* **Culture** is the customs, arts, groups, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group. We advise phasing out the word "culture" for ways-of-working, in favor of "principles", "values", "practices", etc.

Your ways of working are understood. Example: you confirm that each of your teammates is familiar with all the ideas, and also knows where to find out more about the ideas.

Your ways of working are open to debate. Example: you confirm that each of your teammates knows how to suggest changes, and also can provide comments, feedback, and opportunities for new ways of working.
