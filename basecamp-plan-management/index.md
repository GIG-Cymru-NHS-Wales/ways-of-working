# Business Case: Basecamp for DHCW Plan Management

!!! Work In Progress - Request For Comments

## Executive Summary

Urgent need: in two weeks, Joel begins leading many testers, who are working
across many projects, and who have urgent needs for shipping software and for
rapid upskilling. Joel's evaluated many choices and intends to proceed with
a pilot for Basecamp.com for testers and any other staff that want to try it.

## Context

**Current state:** our organization doesn't have a way for all of us to plan
across all of our projects, in a lightweight agile way. This causes three major
burning problems: 1) work isn't visible, leading to miscommunication and missed
deadlines, 2) work is getting lost often, leading to confusion and tribal
pockets, 3) staff are frustrated by not understanding the project
scope/context/schedule, leading to morale suffering.

**Goal state:** our organization aims for organization-wide visibility of
projects, their key dates, key todos, key people, and the like; all staff have
equal access to the tool, and can create projects, dates, todos, stakeholders,
and the like.

**Plan:**  Joel intends to trial Basecamp.com, which is simple plan management
software, that is especially easy to use, and especially easy to purchase right
now because there's a special pricing plan of £300/month for everyone at our
organization plus our consultants and external stakeholders.

**Primary Differentiator**: Basecamp pricing is viable right now, for our entire
staff and stakeholders, at £300/month all in; no other paid cloud tool comes
close because they are approximately £10000/month all in. 

**Secondary Differentiator**: Basecamp is especially user-friendly for working
with external stakeholders, for our operations initiatives in improving our
user-centered design and improving our shift-left testing with UAT. As one
example that's already working well, we can plan the leadership event day using
Basecamp, and invite our technical staff, comms staff, external speakers, and
more into the event day project.

**Context:** Joel is aiming for Basecamp to be a "front door" that provides a
project entry point, and points users to any of our more-advanced existing
systems, such as to internal Sharepoint sites, internal Microsoft Project plans,
internal Jira/Trello boards, and the like. In other words, Basecamp is
just-enough for simple projects, and is icing on the cake for our more-expensive
more-sophisticated systems to help us make the work visible, searchable, and
shareable.

## What is Basecamp?

Basecamp is a project planning tool.

Key features:

- Create a project, to-do list, kanban board, calendar schedule, etc.

- Collaborate with stakeholders, with options for chats, alerts, documents.

- Onboard everyone, including consultants, advisors, auditors, end users.

Comparable features can be found in a wide range of planner products:

- Microsoft office-oriented products such as Project, Planner, Loop, DevOps.
  
- Atlassian developer-oriented products such as Trello, Jira, Confluence.
 
- Notion startup-oriented products such as for todos, wikis, blogs.
  
- Many more such as Asana, Linear, Monday, ClickUp, Workday, Roadmunk.

## Basecamp Value Proposition

### Primary Benefits

**Universal Accessibility**: Basecamp's intuitive interface enables immediate
productivity for novice users while providing powerful search and organization
for experienced users.

**Stakeholder Integration**: Single platform for all project participants,
including external consultants, advisors, and auditors, eliminating access
barriers and tool training overhead.

**Cost Efficiency**: £300 monthly for unlimited users represents exceptional
value compared to per-seat licensing models of enterprise alternatives.

**Immediate Implementation**: Pilot deployment possible immediately without
extensive configuration, training, or migration planning.

## Strategic Positioning

**Basecamp as Entry Point, Not Replacement**: Basecamp can be a simple
front door to plans, in parallel to any existing sophisticated tooling for
specialized needs. Teams using Jira for development sprints or Project for
critical path analysis can continue those workflows while using Basecamp for
stakeholder communication and project discovery.

**Complementary Integration**: Basecamp serves as the accessible layer where all
stakeholders can participate, with deep work continuing in specialized tools as
appropriate.

## Acknowledged Limitations

**Enterprise Features**: Basecamp intentionally omits complex enterprise project
management capabilities:

- Earned value funding

- Critical chain planning

- Advanced resource allocation

- Risk mitigation frameworks

- Strategic capability roadmapping

**Change Management**: Some teams may initially perceive Basecamp as additional
overhead rather than simplification.

- Request communications help and OCP help because Basecamp helps us for
  "Building Our Future" and we could/should connect todos to our Integrated
  Medium Term Plan (IMTP) objectives and milestones.

- Ask pilot participants for anecdotes and learnings that we can merge into a
  business case.

- Continually emphasis the importance of cross-team upskilling and cross-team
  software engineering, rather than silos.

## Assessments

This section has Joel's personal assessments. Anyone else can chime in too.

Joel has used many of these tools on real world projects and teams. Generally
they all work semi-well, and there's no perfect choice until an organization
goes into very large expensive software for enterprise resource planning (ERP).
Each tool has pros and cons, however at the end of the day they're all much too
expensive to use for all our staff. This is why Basecamp is the right choice for
right now.

### Options: Asana, Linear, Workday, ClickUp, Monday, etc.

Asana is my overall favorite for whole-organization projects. But it's harder
than others to customize, and harder than others to use with APIs.

Linear is my favorite for technical task tracking e.g. use cases to code
delivery. In Silicon Valley it's the tool of choice for tech teams. However,
Linear is not user-friendly IMHO and not good with external stakeholders.

All of the others in this category are in the same general range of capabilities
and price points, as of the most-recent time I evaluated options a year ago.

### Options: Atlassian (Trello, Jira, Confluence)

Trello is a favorite for ease of use, plus many integrations, plus excellent
APIs for doing more-advanced calculations. Trello is free for teams up to 10,
then approximately £10/month/user.

Jira/Confluence tend to be end-destinations for many enterprise companies like
ours, because both provide lots of power, though are expensive and often require
customization. We could/should aim for these for everyone within a few years or
so. Basecamp is a step along this path.

### Options: Microsoft (Project, Planner, Loop)

Microsoft Project is excellent I would choose it if cost were no issue, meaning
for the software and also for the upskilling training for all the staff, as well
as the external stakeholders. Even the cheapest-tier plan is "Planner Plan 1 -
$10.00 /user/month" which is vastly more expensive than Basecamp.

I've never used Loop because I've read many cons about it. E.g. "I tried to use
it. but I can't get past the current clunkiness and the endless bugs.", "Tried
it but found it pretty much useless.", "missing fields, lacks reporting, has
glitches, and so on."

### Options: NHS Wales DHCW internal Manage My Milestones

Manage My Milestones (MMM) is an existing DHCW project planner that currently
focuses on DHCW commitments to Welsh Government regarding Integrated Medium Term
Plan (IMTP) milestones. I spoke with the leaders of the MMM initiative, and we
compared notes, such as how fast and easy it is for a staff member to create a
new project, or add an external member of the public, or change a due date, etc.
Everyone I spoke with about this believes that MMM is different than the aims of
Basecamp being flexible and extendable to external people.

### Options: NHS Wales DHCW internal Excel spreadsheets

I found a couple of the internal teams are using custom Excel spreadsheets which
provide excellent tracking, and are well-liked by the teams. These are
maintained by each team, and are not generally available nor scalable across
teams with low overhead. Everyone I spoke with about this believes that an
internal Excel spreadsheet is different than the aims of Basecamp being simple and
available to all staff.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Pilot Launch

- Start with Joel's testers because the need is most urgent.

- Include projects with significant stakeholder involvement, such as the Welsh
  Authentication and Emergency Department Module.

- Run parallel to existing tools, such that teams can continue their full-speed work.

### Phase 2: Rollout

- Expand to more projects based on pilot feedback

- Maintain existing specialized tools where they add clear value

- Establish Basecamp as default for new project initiation

### Success Metrics

- Stakeholder satisfaction with project visibility

- Reduction in "where is this project?" inquiries

- Time-to-productivity for new project participants

- Overall project communication effectiveness

### Build multi-year case for enterprise tooling

- We're a big enterprise building big projects, so we know we'll need big
  software for plan management. There's a saying in tech that all roads lead to
  Jira. To some extent, this is true, because Jira is enormously powerful and
  vastly customizable. But it's very expensive, and also very hard to use
  without taking the baby-step of getting all the projects into one place. 

- We want to aim for Basecamp being 1-3 year stepping stone to prove that
  all-hands plan management helps us, so we can justify the wins with Welsh
  government, so we can justify a much larger budget to obtain Jira or similar
  enterprise plan tooling.
  
## Financial Impact

**Direct Costs**: £300/month (£3,600 annually)

**Opportunity Costs**: Reduced stakeholder confusion, faster project onboarding, improved external party 
engagement

**ROI Timeline**: Expected positive return within 3-6 months through improved project velocity and reduced coordination overhead

## Bias for action

Right now Joel is proceeding with a Basecamp trial account.

- Cost is £30/month paid with his credit card personally, no reimbursement needed. The principle is: Joel's used Basecamp and many other plan management tools, and is confident about using it for the testers; the cost is minimal and per month, so this is perfect for learning more.
 
- The trial account covers Joel's needs for experimenting with the testers and emergency department authentication, and also covers Roxana as a product owner for experimenting with Single Record needs. The principle is: we proceed in pairs, because this broadens our perspectives and improves our collaboration capabilities.
  
- The trial account covers anyone else that Joel & Roxana want to invite to participate. We expect this will quickly include relevant people from communities of practice (especially testing & AI), comms (especially for publishing content and events planning), and UI/UX (especially for user-centered design).

## Recommendation

Proceed with immediate Basecamp pilot focusing on stakeholder-heavy projects.
The combination of low cost, immediate usability, and clear positioning as a
complement to existing tools makes this a low-risk, high-value initiative that
address our organization's current fragmentation challenges while maintaining
investment in specialized tooling where it delivers value.

## If you want to get involved

Message Joel to get an invitation to Basecamp. You'll be able to sign in by
using your normal NHS Wales Google account, meaning you click a button like
"Sign in with Google" then use your normal NHS Wales email address and NHS Wales
password.

If you want to get involved in looking for other planning tools, that's great.
DHCW has an enterprise tooling Teams channel that you can join. We're looking at
more kinds of planning software, such as Roadmunk.com for strategic planning, Jira
for longer-term across-project planning, etc. If you want help with this,
contact Joel.
